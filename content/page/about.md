Hey! üëãüèª

My name is Jan. Once upon a time, I finished a **Masters Degree in Business Information Systems** at TU Darmstadt.
I've been writing software for quite some time, did 6 years of Ruby working while studying and 2 years of Elixir.
Functional programming is something I grew to enjoy a lot, since it fits my approach to problem solving and seems to keep complexity at bay, mostly.
Here are some of my [side projects](/projects).

The operational side of software and making things work really well when the rubber hits the road is very enjoyable to me. I'm also sort of a **performance nerd** in that way, I love benchmarking and optimizing.

During my university career I touched a lot of networking technology and I'm really interested in **Distributed Systems**, how they operate and thinking through the cases where things can go wrong.

Previously, I've been working and learning alongside the great people of [**Grandcentrix**](https://www.grandcentrix.net/) part-time while freelancing on the side. In September 2019, I joined Google Zurich as a Site Reliability Engineer.

Drop me a mail if you think we should have a chat!
